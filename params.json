{"name":"Arad Skill Planner CSS","body":"### Welcome to the ARAD Skill Planner CSS Page\r\nYou can download a copy of the CSS files here to make a theme for the planner, which you can then submit to me or Aquarium.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nBecause I feel like it would be nice to potentially have user contributed themes to the site.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nI suggest you know at least a little CSS before trying to create a theme! I have provided a list of CSS IDs for your use, however. Check the support section (located below) if you need help.\r\nhttps://github.com/DarkstarIV/DFO-Planner-CSS/wiki/CSS-IDs\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAquarium for the planner itself, and the base style css. Darkstar (me) created the dark style. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble styling it? Send me a PM on any of the following sites for help. \r\n\r\n-DFO Source (DarkstarIV)\r\n-Super Sword Action (Darkstar)\r\n-Github (DarkstarIV)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you find an issue with the CSS, please create an issue on the Issues page.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DarkstarIV/DFO-Planner-CSS/issues\r\n\r\nIf you wish to submit new features to the CSS files, please fork the repo, and submit a pull request.","tagline":"CSS files for styling the Arad Skill Planner","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
